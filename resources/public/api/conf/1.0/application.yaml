  title: Notification of Presentation (NOP) Waiver Checker API
  description: |
    This API enables Community System Providers (CSP's) and software developers to check if traders have a valid Notification of Presentation (NOP) Waiver authorisation using their Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number. 
    This waiver is necessary to enable the transit of Not At Risk (NAR) goods moving through from GB-NI. 
    The API follows REST principles and has a single POST method endpoint that returns the data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes.

    Use this API to request the NOP Waiver authorisation status of between 1 and 3000 EORI numbers passed as an array. 

    Note: The API endpoint relates only to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
